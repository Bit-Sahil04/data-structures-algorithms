# Quadtree

Point-region (PR) quadtree Data structure implementation in python and its visualisation

requires pygame 2

## Todo:
- Design a point or node class and operate on those objects instead of pure coordinates (WIP)
- Design a collision system with efficient use of quad tree (WIP)
- Fix collision bug between points of diff radius in point.update() function (WIP)
- Restructure Quad.py to put core functions first followed by utility functions
- Implement neighbour finding algorithm for more efficient insertion <br>
