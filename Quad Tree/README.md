 - Design a collision system with efficient use of quad tree (WIP)
 - implement async highlight function
 - Fix collision bug between points of diff radius in point.update() function
 - fix pop operation
 - test insert operation functionality
 - Fix point collision bug
 - Improve truncate_tree implementation
 - find a way to efficiently store points without modifying the quad tree DS too much
 - Restructure Quad.py to put core functions first followed by utility functions
